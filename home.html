Online Classes are a combination of video recordings and live lectures with course reading and tests. They are generally conducted using a virtual portal through which students gather reading materials, interact with teachers and classmates, view grades, and monitor progress. Online classes have become a part of the new normal and have become an integral part of our lives. Education is a dynamic field that experiences great innovations with every passing day. Digital transformations and the arrival of novel technologies in the Ed-tech sector have acted as a great catalyst collectively because the student outcomes have witnessed tremendous growth.
Ed-tech is simplifying things both for the teachers and the students. For instance, consider the example of a classroom app. It has emerged as a highly popular way of imparting education. Similarly, the use of technology is going to enrich the academic development of the students by providing education with the much-needed digital infrastructure. Greater student-teacher interaction and collaboration is ensured by the application of online classes in day-to-day education.

In 2002, President Bush signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act(ESEA). This federal law allows you to ask for certain information about your child’s classroom teachers, and requires us to give you this information in a timely manner if you ask for it. As a parent of a student in the Union Township School District, you have the right to know the professional qualifications of the classroom teachers who instruct your child. Specifically, you have the right to ask the following information about each of your child’s classroom teachers:

Whether the NJ State Department of Education has licensed or qualified the teacher for the grades and subjects he or she teachers. 
Whether the NJ State Department of Education has decided that the teacher can teach in a classroom without being licensed or qualified under state regulations because of special circumstances.
The teacher's college major; whether the teacher has any advanced degrees and, if so, the subject of the degrees. 
Whether any teahcers' aides or similar paraprofessionals provide services to your child and, if they do, their qualifications. 
Union Township is committed to providing quality instruction for all students and does so by employing the most qualified individuals to teach and support each student in the classroom.  If you would like to receive any of this information, please contact the Superintendent’s Office at 238-6003.
